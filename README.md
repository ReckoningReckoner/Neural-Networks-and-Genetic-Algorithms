# Neural Networks

Some random machine related things:
```
Perceptron - Multi output perceptron for iris setosa data set.
Backpropagation - A feed forward NN with sigmoid activation and gradient descent for win data set.
PCA - Isolating audio features using PCA.
```

The perceptron and NN are implemented in C++. PCA is in Python 3.
